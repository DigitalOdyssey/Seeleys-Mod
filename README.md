# Seeley's Mod

Seeley's Mod is currently in production...

The current items/features it includes are:

## Purple Quartz

An all-new resource that can be found underground that has better properties than diamond. You can create armor, tools, and weapons that are better than all other. If you smelt a purple quartz block (made of 9 purple quartz) you get molten purple quartz, but there is no current use for it.

## Tyline

An new biome that consist of a strange, sand-like substance that when smelted, turns hard. This hard substance can be broken with a pickaxe to get tyline ore, but there is no current use for it.

## Infernal Ore

Even though there is no current use for this ore, it is in the game. I wonder why...
